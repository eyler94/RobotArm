#You can copy this workspace somewhere else, source your version of it, 
#and then change the code as you like or add your own code. 
#That would look like the following

#Baxter runs on python 2 not python 3. 

#Finally, it is possible to run all your code in simulation first, with a nice visuallation.
#you would use a software called gazebo. Unfortunately I don't know a whole ton about it
#so you might have to ask for some help from Dr. Killpack on how to get that up and running.
